- consider changing button setup, have all buttons pull their info from skill resources
- further consider letting each button handle it's own cooldowns/lockout status

- fix various bloody rush targeting issues (can't repeat tiles)
- finish implementation of shift completion (resolve unit collision)

- consider turning the popui into a proper popup, which will help with exclusivity/lockout issues

- let buff bar have it's own script to handle buffs

- write some comments/docs :(


!!!
- messed around with PLAYER_ACTION AND PLAYER_SELECT states so be careful...
- need a better way to figure out when the UI is actually changing to pick out when
	UI is sending commands to wrong unit
- probably just rebuild the button UI system now yeah?
- fix logic around action point check and changing target states... for example maneuvers can't
	really be set to check for move points vs. action points at the moments
