- fix various bloody rush targeting issues (can't repeat tiles)

- consider turning the popui into a proper popup, which will help with exclusivity/lockout issues

- let buff bar have it's own script to handle buffs

- write some comments/docs :(


!!!
- messed around with PLAYER_ACTION AND PLAYER_SELECT states so be careful... SEEMS OK
- need a better way to figure out when the UI is actually changing to pick out when
	UI is sending commands to wrong unit
- fix logic around action point check and changing target states... for example maneuvers can't
	really be set to check for move points vs. action points at the moment

!!!
- queueing system needs more work as right now it can only copy the last action done. That's probably but
	need to make sure that buttons are being replaced and not overwritten
- also some weirdness with signals connecting to queued_cleanup, may be related
- fix mirage shift so you can't teleport into obstacles
