- fix various bloody rush targeting issues (can't repeat tiles)

- consider turning the popui into a proper popup, which will help with exclusivity/lockout issues

- let buff bar have it's own script to handle buffs

- write some comments/docs :(


!!!
- messed around with PLAYER_ACTION AND PLAYER_SELECT states so be careful... SEEMS OK
- need a better way to figure out when the UI is actually changing to pick out when
	UI is sending commands to wrong unit
- fix logic around action point check and changing target states... for example maneuvers can't
	really be set to check for move points vs. action points at the moment

!!!
- queueing system needs more work as right now it can only copy the last action done. That's probably but
	need to make sure that buttons are being replaced and not overwritten
- also some weirdness with signals connecting to queued_cleanup, may be related

!!!
- finish Chimeric Cloak, finish working up system for damage boosting/reduction

!!!
- use casting "as" for good Intellisense stuff
- try using "owner" for various things instead of getting parent... probably not super useful with all the instancing
- Animation players for units... probably not worth it... just stick to tweens and anim sprites
- can we use lerp for anything?
- Learn... shaders?
- Implement more composition!
- CTRL-D to replace variable names
- hey "is_instance_valid" is useful...

!!! - target state could have a target_disjoint substate
